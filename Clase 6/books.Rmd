## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
book_words <- austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE)

book_words
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
total_words <- book_words %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n))

total_words
```

```{r}
book_words <- left_join(book_words, total_words)

book_words
```

```{r}
freq_by_rank <- book_words %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         `term frequency` = n/total)

freq_by_rank
```

```{r}
book_words <- book_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, book, n)

book_words
```

```{r}
book_words %>%
  select(-total) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```

```{r}
book_words %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  top_n(15) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```
